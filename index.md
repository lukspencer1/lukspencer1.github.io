### CPSC 120

* LAB 2 -
I enjoyed lab 2 because it was the most basic introduction to the coding process. As someone who had barely touched programming before this class I was quite nervous. I enjoyed part 2 more since it dealt with outputting strings and I found that more interesting than order of operations. I specifically enjoy the satisfaction I receive when the letters I just typed are printed out, as it is a sense of accomplishment I canâ€™t quite explain. 


* LAB 4 -
I enjoyed lab 4 because I have always struggled with unit conversion and saw it as an opportunity to challenge myself. I welcome a challenge and figured this would be a good time as ever to try and overcome my past struggles with conversions. Although I enjoyed the challenge by far my favorite part was the HI-LO game in part 2. Once again the satisfaction of something working out is one of my favorite feelings and seeing the game operate correctly was rewarding

* LAB 10 -
I enjoyed lab 10 because part-2 deals with my home state, and it made the lab feel more personal. We had to sort counties and since it was from the home of me and many of my peers it felt like a very personable project. It also didn't have a game at the end like lab 4 and some previous labs so the switch in material was appreciated.
