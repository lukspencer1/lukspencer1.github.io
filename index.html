### CPSC 120

* LAB 2
I enjoyed lab 2 because it was the most basic introduction to the coding process. As someone who had barely touched programming before this class I was quite nervous. I enjoyed part 2 more since it dealt with outputting strings and I found that more interesting than order of operations. I specifically enjoy the satisfaction I receive when the letters I just typed are printed out, as it is a sense of accomplishment I canâ€™t quite explain.
